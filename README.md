# Note Taker App
# DESCRIPTION
### In this assigment I created a Note Taker Application. 
### This is some of the requirements:
    - I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
    - I enter a new note title and the note’s text, a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
    - I click on the Save icon, the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
    - I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column
    - I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
